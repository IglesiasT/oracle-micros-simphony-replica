# Oracle Micros Simphony replica

This project tries to imitate the Oracle's Point of Sale software for restaurants [Micros Simphony](https://www.oracle.com/food-beverage/restaurant-pos-systems/simphony-pos/) as a RESTful web service.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### About the application

This web service follows the Representational State Transfer principles, uses Maven as the build tool and the current LTS version of Java, 17.
I hope to add more functionality to this application in the future but for now this project uses the following dependencies:

- Spring MVC
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Mockito
- MySQL Database

### Running the application

You can run this application from your favorite IDE or by running the following command:

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run

## Future features
These are some features that I plan to add to the project so that it scales little by little and eventually becomes a robust one:
- [ ] User logic and hierarchy with different permissions
- [ ] Robust payment authentication
- [ ] Cool frontend

And more...
